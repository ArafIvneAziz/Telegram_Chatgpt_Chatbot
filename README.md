# Telegram_Chatgpt_Chatbot
This repository can make you a Chatbot using NodeJS, OpenAI, and Telegram API's.

To build this Chatbot, you need to clone this "repository" and visit this url:https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and login then create "secret API keys". then paste it on "chat_bot.js"

Then you make your "Telegram_Token" and "Telegram Group" from "@BotFather" --> just say here:'i want to make chatbot', then follow the steps. paste it on "chat_bot.js"

then run the following commend: npm init -y

npm i node-telegram-bot-api openai

node chat_bot.js

go to the Telegram group.

## Then you can chat, and you can also customize your prompts

Thank you
